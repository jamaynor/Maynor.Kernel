# Maynor.Kernel
These are core classes that support .Net 6 software development including domain driven design.

Classes in this assembly fall into two categories:
  - Framework Extensions:
    These classes (mostly static extension classes) simplify common .Net development tasks. For instance the "string".IsNullOrEmpty() method.

  - Domain Driven Design Support:
    Entity and Aggregate Root base classes.
